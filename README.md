This project will predict whether a loan case will be paid off or not--**project is worth 25 pts**.  

This will be completed by using four (4) classificaiton machine learning (ML) algorithms. Points distrubution is as follows:
* k-Nearest Neighbour **(7 pts)**
* Decision Tree **(6 pts)**
* Support Vector Machine **(6 pts)**
* Logistic Regression **(6 pts)**  

Results will be reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics (as applicable):
* Jaccard index
* F1-score
* Log-Loss  

More details of the function of each algorithm, see below:  
* Building model using KNN, finding the best k and accuracy evaluation (7 marks)
* Building model using Decision Tree, finding the best k and accuracy evaluation (6 marks)
* Building model using SVM, finding the best k and accuracy evaluation (6 marks)
* Building model using Logistic Regression, finding the best k and accuracy evaluation (6 marks)
